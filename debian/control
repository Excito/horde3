Description: horde web application framework
 The Horde Framework is written in PHP, and provides the common
 tools a Web application requires: classes for dealing with preferences,
 compression, browser detection, connection tracking, MIME, and more.
 .
 The Horde Framework, by itself, does not provide any significant end user
 functionality; it provides a base for other applications and tools for
 developers. You will probably want to install some of the available Horde
 applications, such as IMP (a webmail client), or Kronolith (a calendar).
 .
 There is a list of Horde applications and projects at
 http://www.horde.org/projects.php.
